# TekBox Comb Generator EMI Calibration Analysis

This repository contains analysis and visualization of conducted EMI measurements
from a TekBox comb generator, comparing results between two LISNs:

- **ATTEN-166**
- **EMCO-3810**

The data is evaluated across multiple comb frequencies and plotted over the full
conducted emissions range.
